## Running the project

- go to project directory
- run `npm i` to install all dependencies (just a first time)
- run `npm start` (it runs the app in the development mode and it should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser)


## Testing the project

In the project directory run `npm test`. It launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
Run `npm test -- --coverage` to see coverage report. Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.


## Production build

To run a production build use command `npm run build`. It builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
